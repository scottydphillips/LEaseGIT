# LEaseGIT
 

## Description:
Property owners are always looking for an easy and fast way to list their property whether on sale or for rent. We want to give owners a way to get in touch with tenants, and tenants a way that they can easily find their new home. Finally, we want to give both owners and tenants a way that they can design different layouts using their furniture to optimize their space within the property and make it feel like home, even before moving in.

## User Story:
* As an owner I want to list my property and attract potential tenants by providing an animated floor plan.

* As a tenant I want to search for a  list of properties available for rent  and design a home with furniture based on the layout of the property.



## Technologies Used:
					
* MySQL and Sequelize ORM for database.
* Node. Js and Express. Js to create API
* Handlebars. Js as the template engine.
* Included authentication(express-session and cookies)
* CSS handler framework: Bootstrap
* Matter. js for room layout tool
* Dotenv (for environmental variables)
* Bcrypt to hash password
* Heroku to deploy site
