# LEaseGIT
 

## Description:
Property owners are always looking for an easy and fast way to list their property whether on sale or for rent. We want to give owners a way to get in touch with tenants, and tenants a way that they can easily find their new home. Finally, we want to give both owners and tenants a way that they can design different layouts using their furniture to optimize their space within the property and make it feel like home, even before moving in.


# Technologies Used:
					
* MySQL and Sequelize ORM for database.					
* Node. Js and Express. Js to create API.				
* Handlebars. Js as the template engine.
* Included authentication(express-session and cookies)
* CSS handler framework: Bootstrap
* Matter. js for room layout.
